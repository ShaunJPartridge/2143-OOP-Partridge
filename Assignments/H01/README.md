### **Definitions**

#### **Abstraction**
```
 Using data from a larger pool to show only the relevant details
 to the object. It helps to reduce programming complexity and 
 effort.
```
#### **Attributes**
```
 Are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state
 or quality of the class or instance.
```
#### **Class**
```
 Is a blueprint for creating objects, a particular data structure,
 providing initial values for member variables or attributes, and
 implementations of member functions or methods. The user-defined
 objects are created using the keyword, class.
```
#### **Class Variable**
```
 Is any variable declared with the static modifier of which a
 single copy exists, regardless of how many instances of the
 class exists.
```
#### **Composition**
```
 The process of building complex objects from simpler ones.
```
#### **Encapsulation**
```
 The idea of bundling data and methods that manipulate the data,
 and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.
```
#### **Friends**
```
 A friend function, that is a "friend" of a given class, is a
 function that is granted the same access as methods to private
 and protected data. It is declared by the class that is granting
 access and is part of the class interface.
