### **Definitions**

#### **Abstraction**
```
 Using data from a larger pool to show only the relevant details
 to the object. It helps to reduce programming complexity and 
 effort.
```
#### **Attributes**
```
 Are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state
 or quality of the class or instance.
```
#### **Class**
```
 Is a blueprint for creating objects, a particular data structure,
 providing initial values for member variables or attributes, and
 implementations of member functions or methods. The user-defined
 objects are created using the keyword, class.
```
#### **Class Variable**
```
 Is any variable declared with the static modifier of which a
 single copy exists, regardless of how many instances of the
 class exists.
```
#### **Composition**
```
 The process of building complex objects from simpler ones.
```
#### **Encapsulation**
```
 The idea of bundling data and methods that manipulate the data,
 and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.
```
#### **Friends**
```
 A friend function, that is a "friend" of a given class, is a
 function that is granted the same access as methods to private
 and protected data. It is declared by the class that is granting
 access and is part of the class interface.
```
#### **Inheritance**
```
 Is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object
 or class that was previously made. An inherited class is called
 a subclass of its parent class or super class.
```
#### **Instance Variable**
```
 Is a variable defined in a class, for which each instantiated
 object of the class has a seperate copy, or instance.
```
#### **Member Variable**
```
 Is a variable that is associated with a specific object or class,
 and accessible for all of its methods.
```
#### **Method**
```
 Is a function of a class or object that manipulates the member
 variables of its class or object.
```
#### **Multiple Inheritance**
```
 Is when a class or object can inherit characteristics and features
 from more than one parent object or parent class.
```
#### **Object**
```
 Is a component of a program that knows how to perform certain 
 actions and how to interact with other elements of the program.
 Objects are the basic units of Object Oriented Programming.
```
#### **Overloading**
```
 Defining the same method multiple times so that you can call them
 with different argument lists(a method's argument list is called
 its signature.
```
#### **Polymorphism**
```
 Is the provision of a single interface to entities of different
 types or the use of a single symbol to represent multiple 
 different types.
```
#### **Public/Private/Protected**
```
 Are access modifiers that help us implement encapsulation. They 
 tell the compiler which other classes should have access to the
 field or method being defined. Public means and class can refer 
 to the field or call the method. Private means only the current
 class will have access to the field or method. Protected means
 only the current class and subclasses of this class will have
 access to the field or method.
```
#### **Virtual**
```
 When a funtion or a method's behavior is overridden within an 
 inheriting class by a function with the same signature.
```
